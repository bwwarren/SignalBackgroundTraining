# SignalBackgroundTraining
The goal of this notebook is to train images of JZ0W (background) interactions and ZvvHbb (signal) interactions using Deep Learning such that we will be able to distinguish the two effectively. 

It incorporates a lot of data cleaning ontop of the cleaning done on the ROOT files prior to getting the hdf5 files.

It makes use of images already converted from ROOT into numpy arrays.
