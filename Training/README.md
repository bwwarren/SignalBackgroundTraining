# Data and Jupyter Notebook 

All of the data is found in the JZ0W_hdf5 and ZvvHbb_hdf5 files. There are 4 hdf5 files in each directory and each file contains 250 events. This totals 1000 events for each type of interaction and 2000 events all in all. This data was transformed using a modification of kratsg's gML file on github: https://github.com/kratsg/gML.git

I also ran this conversion from from ntuple to hdf5 on UChicago's Tier 3. This makes it easier, so that you don't have to run these conversions on your own computer. However if you want to run it on your own computer you will need to have ROOT and root_numpy installed. But I recommend setting up a Tier 3 account. 

For the Jupyter Notebook, I am using [insert packages here]
